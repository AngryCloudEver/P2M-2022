on every round:
1. Industry produces power
	1. IF [ power stored < max power stored ]:
		1. FOREACH [ power source ]:
			- cleaner sources are preferred
			1. IF [ power stored < max power stored ]
				THEN:
					1. IF [ money > power production cost ]
						THEN [ industry produces power ]
						ELSE [ skip ]
					2. IF [ industry produced power ]:
						THEN [ industry produces power source pollution ]
						ELSE [ skip ]
				ELSE:
					[ skip ]
2. Industry produces food
	1. IF [ power, money > food production cost ]:
		THEN [ industry produces food ]
		ELSE [ skip ]
		- sure we want power to be part of production cost ???
	2. IF [ industry produced food ]:
		THEN [ industry produces production pollution ]
		ELSE [ industry produces idle pollution ]
		- random pollution ???
	3. IF [ industry produced food ]:
		THEN [ industry produces random money ]
		ELSE [ skip ]
		- simulates successful / failed product
		- allows possibility to lose money, avoids infinite money positive
		  feedback loop
3. Policy RNG is adjusted
	1. IF [ industry produced power ] AND [ industry produced food ]:
		THEN [ policy rng += sufficient power, food policy rng impact ]
		ELSE:
			IF [ industry produced power ]:
				THEN:
					[ policy rng += sufficient power policy rng impact ] AND
					[ policy rng -= food scarcity policy rng impact ]
				ELSE:
					[ policy rng -= power, food scarcity policy rng impact ]
4. Player chooses policy
	1. Generate 3 policies randomly with bias according to policy rng
		- we gonna find a **** ton of hidden stats we need to support the
		  charade of the visible ones :)
	2. Player can pick a policy or reject all
5. Reputation is adjusted
	1. IF [ player accepts popular policy or rejects unpopular policy ]:
		THEN [ [ ??? ] chance to increase popularity ]
		ELSE:
			IF [ player rejects unpopular policy or accepts unpopular policy ]:
				THEN [ [ ??? ] chance to decrease popularity ]
	- we gonna be here for a while to document the mess we made (it turns out
	  the number of edges in a n-vertex gets plenty real quick :)
	- this is scope and feature creep for now but hooooooooo boy does desg get
	  to have fun with various ending scenarios as achievements

every policy got:
	- desc (story)
	- cash cost
	- policy popularity
	- stats affected (follow the consequence chain ???)

- RobbinFood:
	- "A series of thefts have been reported recently. Curiously, the stolen
	  goods consists exclusively of food. Police investigations report the
	  job was not particularly professional, but enough to stump them. This
	  bill will authorize the hiring of additional personel to aid the theft
	  investigations."
	- 500
		- local issue, cheap to address
	- 60%
	- Agree:
		- reputation += 5%
		- money -= 1000
			- it costs money to hire
		- ppl happy they dont gotta worry about food theft again
	- Disagree:
		- reputation -= 5%
		- food -= 3

- PetroBigBro:
	- "The fossil fuel industry is noticing the shift in attitude towards
	  cleaner energy in the populace and is making anticipatory moves.
	  Several of the largest oil companies are requesting an increase of
	  oil price caps, potentially causing oil prices to soar to record high
	  prices as they try to lose their stock while transitioning to the new
	  markets. This bill will increase oil price caps to support companies
	  while they transition."
	- 2000
		- lawyers + deal with central govt
	- 50%
	- Agree:
		- reputation += 8%
		- money += 5000
		- pollution -= 3%
		- most oil companies survive the transition just fine, ppl dont
		  mind the higher price since it incentivizes transition
	- Disagree:
		- reputation += 3%
		- industry -= 3%
		- most oil companies survive the transition just fine, but some dont
	- anything flies
- RedGreenBurn
	- "The sun shines in the bright blue sky. Unfortunately, it has spawned a
	  bright red flame among the bright green leaves of the forest, causing
	  massive damage to the environment. The central government is willing to
	  aid, but a major part of the bill will still need to be footed by the
	  local government. This bill will allow the formation of a joint
	  firefighting force to deal with the forest fire."
	- 2000
	- 60%
	- Agree:
		- reputation += 5%
		- money -= 5000

	- should agree
- PlantGrant
	- "Your city has been invited to participate in an international tree planting
	  competition in a bid to promote the dire need of regeneration of forests
	  around the world. A lot of people are excited about the competition. This
	  bill will formally declare the city's participation in the competition."

	- 50%
	- Agree:
		- reputation += 3%
		- money -= 2000
			- participation fee, tree seed costs, etc.
		- pollution -= 8%
		- we didnt win but ppl r glad to participate anyway
		- critics fear the future of the trees tho, a lot of tree planting isnt
		  followed by tree maintenance and the trees just die (legit thing irl)
			- edu component :)
	- Disagree:
		- reputation -= 8%
			- rather surprising for such a env progressive city to not join
		- industry += 3%
			- turns out they were preparing to join but since it got cancelled
			  the spare resources can be used elsewhere
		- pollution -= 5%
			- so surprising that a few others ended up not joining as well
		- ppl very disappointed they didnt end up joining
- TreeToFood
	- "A major player in the food industry is eager to expand operations and is
	  requesting a forest-clearing permit, concluding that the forest was too
	  small to be productive for logging operations despite massive protests by
	  various environmental impact analysis experts. They claim the extra space
	  would allow them to produce food for less money and more efficiently and
	  are threatening to take their business elsewhere if not allowed to grow.
	  This bill will grant the company a forest-clearing permit."

	- "A neighborhood complained that the roads in their neighborhood have
	  fallen into disrepair. A few people have taken the issue to social media
	  and pressing the city's Public Infrastructures Department to take action,
	  however the department advised that the repairs will require a section of
	  a nearby river to be reclaimed, potentially destroying the habitat of
	  various local fishes and reducing the amount of water that flows
	  downstream. This bill will authorize road repairs for the neighborhood."
